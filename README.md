# Prodigy_DS_Task3
Project Description:
Question: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Project Title : Bank Marketing

Additional Information: The dataset comprises direct marketing campaign data from a Portuguese banking institution, where phone calls were made to clients to promote term deposits. The dataset includes demographic attributes like age, job, marital status, education, as well as behavioral features such as balance, loan status, previous contact duration, and outcome of the previous marketing campaign.

Approach: We employed a decision tree classifier to analyze the data. This algorithm recursively partitions the data based on the features, creating a tree-like structure of decisions. By training the classifier on historical data, we aimed to predict whether a client would subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit.

Outcome: The trained decision tree classifier achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy score] on the test data. This predictive model can assist banking institutions in targeting potential customers more effectively, optimizing their marketing efforts, and improving the success rate of term deposit subscriptions.
